## Background
Village or Oor is where we live and/or where we feel attachment to.  Oor forms a basic unit of social, political, economical and cultural organization.  For many, the native place where they or their ancestors are from is key part of their identity and belonging.  Oor also can be an oppressive place, where age old caste system, patriarchy and superstitions trample individual and collective freedoms.  Village documentation aims to document, digitally preserve, provide access to information about the history, geography, natural and physical environment, people, organizations, statistics and works about a village.

## Purpose
